# 🔐 AWS CI/CD Pipeline with Security Best Practices

This project showcases a secure, modular CI/CD pipeline built using AWS native services such as CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, with a strong emphasis on DevSecOps practices. It supports automated build, test, and deployment workflows, integrated with robust monitoring, auditing, and security mechanisms.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern software development requires rapid delivery without compromising security. This AWS CI/CD pipeline is designed to:
- Automate deployments across environments (EC2, ECS, Lambda)
- Protect sensitive operations using IAM, Secrets Manager, and WAF
- Enable secure source control integration (GitHub / CodeCommit)
- Offer detailed auditing via CloudTrail and CloudWatch

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Source Control**: GitHub or AWS CodeCommit
- **CI/CD Tools**: CodePipeline → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy
- **Security**: IAM roles, Secrets Manager, WAF, Private Subnets
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, X-Ray
- **Scalability**: Auto Scaling, ECS Fargate, Lambda-ready

## 🔧 Implementation Summary

1. **IAM Setup** – Create least-privilege roles for pipeline stages  
2. **Source Control** – Trigger builds on GitHub pushes or PRs  
3. **CodeBuild** – Runs automated tests and security scans  
4. **S3 + Artefacts** – Store build output securely  
5. **CodeDeploy** – Automate blue/green or rolling deployments  
6. **Monitoring** – Enable logging, alerts, and tracing  
7. **Security Best Practices** – Use WAF, Secrets Manager, and VPC separation
